// The while Loop
/* Idea: Abacus?
Initial condition: all beads start away from the center beam
10+2 columns, 2 beads top deck, 5 bottom deck
As count up, to upper limit of 5, lower deck beads rise towards beam.
On count of 5, lower deck column full
If x > 5 on that column, lower deck beads drop back away from beam and single top
deck bead drops to beam,
